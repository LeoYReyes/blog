I recently got back from a trip to Ecuador with my dad. I'd like to write a detailed post about everything I did, but I personally hate long articles, so I'm going to let pictures do the talking (also I suck at writing).

The last time I was in Ecuador, I was 13. I think at that age I didn't really appreciate traveling as much as I do now. Going to Ecuador made me realize that I take a lot of things for granted. I've always wanted more than what I have, and I never appreciated what I have as much as I should have. 

The overall trip was amazing! I got to experience both the developed and undeveloped areas of the country. The undeveloped areas interested me more, because 1) it's not something I'm used to seeing around where I live and 2) it made the trip seem more adventurous (probably related to 1, it being really foreign to me).

One of the most interesting part of the trip was definitely the drive. Getting to see the change in landscape and vegetation as we went from the coast, up into the highlands was an incredible experience.
